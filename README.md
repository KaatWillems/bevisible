## Evaluation

This was the first project where we had to connect with a backend API (Node JS) from another classmate, Clement. The fact that Clement was working simultanuously on the API, made things extra complex and we had to be very flexible :). But it was a nice experience! We did not manage to make everything work in the end, but we learned that communication is key and that CORS issues are very annoying!
